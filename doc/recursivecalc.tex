%--------------------------------------------------
In this section, now, we do the final recursive calculation. To understand the deep structure we will do this by discussing the first steps by manually calculation. We will see, it exists different ways how you can look at each situation/problem in each step, hence this will mainly a discussion of this different ways.

\section{Recursion step: $n^{\left(0\right)} = 0$}
\label{s:recursionstepn0_0}
%--------------------------------------------------
We start our calculation with an easy consideration. We assume, we know $3$ and $5$ are prime numbers.
